# README.md - Vim-like Interface

Welcome to the Vim-like README! Use the commands below to navigate through this guide.

---

**Normal Mode**

Press `Esc` to enter Normal mode.

- **Navigation:**
  - `h`, `j`, `k`, `l`: Move left, down, up, right (just like in Vim)
  - `0`: Move to the beginning of the line
  - `$`: Move to the end of the line
  - `/text`: Search for "text" in this README

---

**Insert Mode**

Press `i` to enter Insert mode for editing the text.

- Once in Insert mode, type freely to "edit" (this is a simulated Vim experience; in a real Vim editor, this would allow text modifications).

Press `Esc` to return to Normal mode.

---

**Commands**

- `:w`: Save the README (pretend action; you actually need to use Git commands to save)
- `:q`: Quit the Vim-like README experience
- `:wq`: Save and quit
- `:help`: Display help (that's this section you're reading now)

---

**Visual Mode**

Press `v` in Normal mode to enter Visual mode.

- Highlight text using `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` for character navigation.

---

**Command-line Mode**

Press `:` in Normal mode to enter Command-line mode.

- Use `:w`, `:q`, `:wq`, or `:help` commands in this section.

> **Note**: This is a simulated Vim interface in Markdown. It aims to give a Vim-like feel but doesn't replicate real interactive Vim features.

Happy coding with this Vim-inspired README!
